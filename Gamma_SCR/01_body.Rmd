# Abstract

<!-- Many data-limited stock assessments rely on survey indices for the provision of science advice. Design-based estimators of stock size are often applied, however, the quantification of uncertainty around these estimates remains a challenge. Standard practice has been to use quantiles from a Student's t distribution even though this method sometimes produces negative intervals. As an alternate method, we propose the use of the Gamma distribution to approximate uncertainty around survey indices. This involves the translation of unbiased design-based mean and variance estimators to shape and scale parameters for the Gamma distribution. Via simulation testing, we show that densities derived from the Gamma distribution closely match densities derived from bootstraped samples of simulated survey data. We also highlight an application of this method to Redfish in NAFO division 3O. We argue that this approach offers a reasonable approximation of uncertainty that can be used to quantify stock status and inform risk-based management decisions. -->


# Introduction

A primary objective of fisheries-independent trawl surveys is to obtain indices of stock size and quantify the uncertainty around these indices. Such information plays a critical role in the assessment and management of fish stocks around the world as they often serve as a leading indicator of trend and status [@pennington1998; @kimura2006]. Quantifying uncertainty around stock size, trends, and status is a challenging but necessary task as fisheries management increasingly relies on such information to characterize the risk associated with alternative management options. Whenever possible, this quantification of uncertainty is done using stock assessment models which are often calibrated using survey-based indices. However, data limitations, complex stock dynamics, and operational capacity constraints often preclude the implementation of complex stock assessment models. In these cases, the assessment of the stock tend to be based on the survey indices themselves, together with any additional biological and ecological information that may be available. Therefore, when assessments are survey-based, the quantification of uncertainty of the survey indices becomes a primary source for informing risk.

Fisheries surveys are generally based on standard sampling techniques and indices are commonly derived using design-based estimators. In the Northwest Atlantic, major bottom trawl surveys follow a stratified-random sampling design with proportional allocation [e.g., @gonzalez2022; @rideout2022], and the biomass and abundance indices are calculated accordingly [e.g., @smith1981]. The derivation of the standard mean and variance estimators from a stratified-random sampling design is constructed using the general properties of the mean and variance, building these estimators from the straightforward concept that the overall mean represents a weighted average of the strata means, and where the weights applied are constants derived from the stratification scheme [e.g., @cochran1977]. One important feature of this derivation is that it does not depend on any assumed distribution; the estimators of the mean and variance are valid irrespective of the underlying distribution. Approximate confidence intervals, in contrast, depend on an assumed distribution.

Standard confidence intervals are approximated using quantiles from a Normal distribution, when sample size is large, or a Student's t distribution, when sample sizes are small [i.e., few degrees of freedom per stratum; @cochran1977]. However, given both distributions permit negative values, this standard assumption may not be reasonable when analyzing strictly positive quantities like biomass and abundance [@cadigan2011]. The issue of negative lower bounds from this approximation is therefore an artifact of the assumed distribution rather than the stratified-random mean and variance estimators. This justifies the application of resampling techniques like bootstrap to derive more realistic confidence intervals for stratified-random estimators.

While resampling techniques can be an effective tool to generate confidence intervals, depending on the case in hand, they could require additional computing power and programming efforts. These additional steps should not be a deterrent to implementing them when required but having a simpler alternative that addresses the issues linked to the normal approximation can also be useful. A cursory examination of biomass and abundance indices from research surveys not only shows that there are no negative values (naturally), but that the distributions are seldom symmetrical; long positive tails are often observed. Given these features, a logical choice for describing these data  is the Gamma distribution. This distribution is always positive, and depending on the parametrization, it can be fairly symmetrical (i.e. normal-like) or have a long right tail. We propose that by simply changing the assumed distribution from Normal to Gamma we can provide a better approximation to the confidence intervals which does not suffer from undesired features (e.g. negative lower values), while better resembling observed distributions (e.g. asymmetrical distribution with longer positive tails).


# Methods

Provided data from a stratified-random survey, average trawlable abundance or biomass ($\hat{\mu}$) and sampling variance ($\hat{\sigma}^2$) can be estimated using standard design-based formula [@cochran1977; @smith1981; @smith1990]. Instead of using a Student's t distribution to describe uncertainty and allow negative values, we apply the Gamma distribution by translating $\hat{\mu}$ and $\hat{\sigma}^2$ to scale ($\hat{\theta}$) and shape ($\hat{\kappa}$) parameters as follows:

$$\hat{\theta} = \frac{\hat{\sigma}^2}{\hat{\mu}}, ~~ \text{and} ~~ \hat{\kappa} = \frac{\hat{\mu}^2}{\hat{\theta}}.$$

Provided these values, density, quantile, and random functions for the Gamma distribution can be used to calculate probabilities. For instance, the probability that the index increased from one year to the next can be quantified. For some cases there might also be a need to calculate the probability that the current index is above or below an average level from a reference period, $\hat{\mu}_{r}$. If the reference period is based on the index, then the level cannot be perfectly known. To account for uncertainty around this reference, $\hat{\sigma}^2_{r}$, it is necessary to combine the variances across the indices. This is accomplished by averaging the means and summing equally weighted variances across a reference set of years $R$, where $|R|$ is the size of the set, 

$$\hat{\mu}_{r} = \frac{\sum_{y = 1}^{|R|} \hat{\mu_y}}{|R|}, ~ \text{and} ~ \hat{\sigma}_r^2 = \frac{\sum_{y = 1}^{|R|} \hat{\sigma}^2_y}{|R|}.$$
This assumes that the estimates being averaged are independent. As above, $\hat{\mu}_{r}$ and $\hat{\sigma}^2_{r}$ can be converted to $\hat{\theta}$ and $\hat{\kappa}$ parameters to approximate uncertainty.


## Simulation

We simulated a redfish-like population using the R package SimSurvey [@regular2020]. The simulated population was based on the exponential decay cohort model where parameter settings for mortality, recruitment, and growth were based on assessments of redfish on the Grand Bank. The simulated population were distributed through an area according to the age-year-space covariance with a parabolic relationship with depth. This survey area was 300 x 300 km with 10 km^2^ cell size and had 30 depth-based strata. We simulated stratified random sampling with a 2 m wide trawl hauled for a distance of 1.5 km. The population and survey were simulated over 20 years. The number of sets in a stratum was proportional to its area (approximately 1 set per 1000 km^2^) and the minimum set per stratum was 2. The survey simulation was replicated five times over the same population.

Average trawlable abundance ($\hat{\mu}$) and sampling variance ($\hat{\sigma}^2$) was calculated by year and replicate (20 years across 5 surveys) using standard design-based estimators [@smith1981; @smith1990] and these estimates were translated to scale ($\hat{\theta}$) and shape ($\hat{\kappa}$) parameters for the Gamma distribution as described above. To compare densities obtained from the Gamma distribution with densities based on an empirical approach, we applied a non-parametric bootstrap to resample the observations (sets) independently within each stratum with replacement. The resampling and calculation of the mean bootstrap estimator were repeated 1000 times with the R package boot [@canty2021]. Densities from these boostrap samples were computed for each year and survey replicate for comparison to the Gamma approximation.

This simulation can be replicated using code in [Appendix A](#app:appendix-a).

## Application

During the 2022 assessment of Redfish in NAFO division 3O, candidate biomass reference points were examined using indices derived from the Canadian spring and fall surveys of 3O. Given relative stability in catches through the history of the fishery, and trends in survey indices, the survey time series is considered to represent normal conditions for this stock (i.e. no apparent prolonged period of collapse). The average of the survey time series was therefore considered a reasonable proxy for B~MSY~ [REF?] and, following the NAFO precautionary approach framework [@nafo2004], 30% of B~MSY~ would be considered the limit reference point (LRP).

To combine indices from the spring and fall surveys, and account for uncertainty associated with estimates from both surveys, annual stratified means and variances from each survey were integrated using the properties of the variance and translated to shape and scale parameters for use in the gamma distribution following the abovementioned equations. In years when a survey index is missing, the available survey is used in place of the mean and variance estimate. This same approach was applied to account for the uncertainty in the B~MSY~ proxy by applying the gamma distribution informed by averaged point estimates of mean and variance.

# Results and Discussion

The Gamma probability density distribution showed high variability among survey simulations, as did the bootstrap samples (Figure \@ref(fig:comp-den). Nevertheless, the shape of both the Gamma density and the bootstrap samples were similar across all years and survey replicates, indicating that the Gamma distribution provides a reasonable approximation of the uncertainty around the stratified estimates. The similarity holds when survey indices are aggregated (Figure \@ref(fig:ref-den)). Though further quantitative analysis is required to assess the performance of these methods for calculating the confidence intervals, these results indicate that confidence intervals from the Gamma approach would be similar to those obtained using bootstrap samples. At the very least, confidence intervals from the Gamma distribution represents an improvement over the sometimes negative intervals derived from the t-distribution.

The B~MSY~ proxy and associated limit reference point (30% B~MSY~ proxy) proposed for redfish was accepted as an interim reference point as was the Gamma-based method for quantifying uncertainty. Since this proxy is based on survey indices, it is not considered perfectly known. Estimates were therefore aggregated to account for this uncertainty. Determining status relative to the LRP considering uncertainty in both the proxy-BMSY and the current Biomass level provides was considered the most fulsome formulation of uncertainty in stock status and the most precautionary approach to advice.

It is important to note, however, that survey indices can show unrealistic fluctuations year over year. This is apparent in both the simulations and across the refish indices. Large inter-annual fluctuations may be a consequence of sampling noise or distribution shifts. A single year may therefore be insufficient to indicate a true change in stock status.
